# Experience Points

# You've been hired by a game studio to work on their latest role-playing game. In this game adventurers need experience 
# points (XP) to level up and become stronger. You've been tasked with creating a function to calculate the total amount 
# of XP needed for a player to reach a specific level.

# Each character starts with 0 XP at level 1. To reach the next level, they need XP equal to their current level times 5.
# Level 	Total XP Gained 	XP To Next Level
# 1 	0 	5
# 2 	5 	10
# 3 	15 	15
# 4 	30 	20
# Assignment

# Complete the calculate_experience_points function.

# The calculate_experience_points function takes a single parameter named level. Determine the total XP needed to reach 
# the specified level from level 1 and return it.
